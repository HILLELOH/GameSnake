# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic game allows you to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer. Your goal is to eat as many apples as possible without running into the walls or into yourself.

## Installation

To play the Snake Game, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Snake Game files**: You can download the Snake Game files from the GitHub repository or any other source where it's available. You can also clone the repository using Git. Here's an example command to clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SnakeGame.git
   
a) **Ensure you have Java installed**: Make sure you have Java installed on your computer. You can check if Java is installed by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   java -version

If you see a version number, Java is installed. If not, you can download and install Java from Java's official website.

b) **Compile the code** (if necessary): If the SnakeGame.java file is not pre-compiled, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Snake Game and compile it using the javac command:

   ```bash
   javac SnakeGame.java
This will generate a SnakeGame.class file.

## Running the Game
Now that you have the game files and Java installed, follow these steps to play the Snake Game:

1) Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded or cloned the Snake Game files.

2) Run the game by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
java SnakeGame
3) The game should start, and you'll see a window with the Snake Game interface.

## Playing the Game
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) on your keyboard to control the snake's direction. The objective is to eat the apples that appear on the screen without running into the walls or yourself. As you eat apples, the snake will grow longer.

The game continues until you either collide with the wall or the snake's own body. Try to achieve the highest score by eating as many apples as you can!

## Quitting the Game
To quit the game, simply close the game window or press the close button on the window's title bar.
